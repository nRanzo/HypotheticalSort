 * The HypotheticalSort class implements a non-standard sorting algorithm
 * designed to explore optimization possibilities in specific cases where

 * most frequent element (mode) in the array and sorts only the remaining 
 * elements, based on the assumption that the mode is already in its correct 
 * position or does not require re-sorting.
 * 
 * <p><b>Research Note:</b> This algorithm is conceptual and aims to highlight 
 * the impact of isolating redundant sorting operations. It does not improve 
 * on the established O(n log n) complexity for general sorting tasks, as the 
 * overhead of mode identification is significant.</p>
 *
 * <p>This approach may be beneficial in specialized datasets where a single 
 * value is highly repetitive, reducing the effective workload for sorting 
 * the remaining elements.</p>
